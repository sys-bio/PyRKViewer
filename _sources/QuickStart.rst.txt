====================
Quick Start
====================

--------------------------------------------------
RUNNING AND BUILDING
--------------------------------------------------

**Running locally:**

* If you have ``pipenv``, run ``pipenv install`` and then ``python main.py``.

* If not, you may use ``pip`` with ``requirements.txt`` and ``requirements-dev.txt``. They are generated from the Pipfile and may not be up-to-date though, so check the commit history to make sure.

--------------------------------------------------
Building an Executable with Pyinstaller:
--------------------------------------------------

* Always run ``pyinstaller rkviewer.spec`` when ``rkviewer.spec`` is present.

* If somehow ``rkviewer.spec`` went missing or you want to regenerate the build specs, run ``pyinstaller -F --windowed --add-data ext/Iodine.dll;. main.py`` on Windows or ``pyinstaller -F -- windowed --add-data ext/Iodine.dll:. main.py`` on Linux/Mac to generate a file named ``main.spec``. Note that if a ``main.spec`` file is already present it will be overwritten.

--------------------------------------------------
USING ON DIFFERENT PLATFORMS
--------------------------------------------------

The python version for development was 3.7.7.

**Mac Notes:**

* pyinstaller and wxPython require a python built with ``enable-framework`` on. Therefore, one should do ``env PYTHON_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-framework" pyenv install 3.7.7`` and use that Python installation for building.

* If the text is blurry in the app bundled by ``pyinstaller``, one needs to add an entry in the pyinstaller settings as described in https://stackoverflow.com/a/40676321 .

**Linux Notes:**

* To install wxPython on linux, see https://wxpython.org/blog/2017-08-17-builds-for-linux-with-pip/index.html. ``requirements-dev.txt`` and ``requirements.txt`` assume the user is on Ubuntu 18.04 for readthedocs. If you have a different distro and have trouble using ``requirements.txt``, just install wxPython manually using the previous link.

* Related to the last note, if readthedocs start having trouble building wxPython, understand that it might be because readthedocs updated its distro from Ubuntu 18.04. Go to ``requirements-dev.txt`` and change the line above ``wxPython`` to look in the appropriate link.
